# ELM-Binary-Classifier

Is is a feed-forward neural network known as Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) Binary classifier, adtaped for use from GitHub (popcornell, 2018) for a Masters Thesis, determining if an unbiast approach to image classification can prove its worth in comparison to other models. This was adapted in the intrests of cyber forensics. The project was undertaken in Google Colab and made use of Tensorflow and Hugging Face's Gradio. 

The main changes found are: 

- Importing Dataset from locally saved storage form an external source.
- Adding the epoch count to watch the progress of the training
- Adding a system to compare the results against a user uplaoded image
- Added Huuging Face's Gradio to allow the use of comparision is a web UI, providing the Colab session is active!
